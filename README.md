# MyTube - React Native YouTube clone

**Work in progress!**

I use the YouTube mobile app on a daily basis. While I mostly enjoy the user experience, I am quite bothered by the constant bombardment of ads and lack of basic features such as offline videos and background audio playback. YouTube offers a premium version that solves all of these issues... for a whopping \$15 per month. I don't believe the price is worth the additional features. Fortunately, I am a software engineer.

## Introducing... MyTube üéâ

MyTube is an alternative app to the official YouTube mobile app. It is built using React Native and will support both iOS and Android. The goal is to essentially create a clone of the YouTube app with some _slight_ modifications.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

MyTube does not meet YouTube's policies as it uses web scraping and alternative methods to gather data. YouTube's official API enacts a quota limit of 10,000 units per day which severely limits the usability of this application. To get around this, alternative methods to gather data was required to ensure a smooth user experience.
